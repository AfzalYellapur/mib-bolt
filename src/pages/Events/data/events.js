    fullDesc: "PUPA is an accelerated entrepreneurial experience for students organized and executed by MiB (Make in BVB) students. It all started with a suggestion made by an industrialist back in 2013 to connect students’ intellectual ability to monetization. PUPA, as the name suggests, is a transient state wherein student teams garner key resources and turn out products just like a beautiful and lively Butterfly over 4 weeks. Being held since last seven years, PUPA has generated keen attention from institutions all over the state of Karnataka. The products being made, demonstrated and sold by students from High school, Commerce, Medical and Engineering streams, is simply beyond brilliance. It’s been a platform that has helped participants put their best foot forward in exhibiting their entrepreneurial talent.",

The student teams go through elaborate sessions on understanding the domain to work on, understanding the user engagement, talking about what they want to do, generating multiple ideas, screening through each idea carefully, pitching it before an eminent panel, rephrasing and re -working upon it, until a desirable outcome is achieved.During each stage the students get mentored through senior student buddies, pre-trained faculty members and industry experts. The entire program is activity based and hence it reinforces experiential learning in students.",

    fullDesc: "A business plan competition where students from second and third year of engineering participate to pitch a plan, which they are interested in pursuing as an incubated venture at CTIE. Since this competition takes place at the end of third year, those students selected get mentored and do their venture planning during their fourth year of engineering. This enables the students to bridge the gap between ideating and commercializing the idea.Students who have finished the second year of engineering, get awarded and can continue their journey of venture planning independently. Mentorship will be available to the students throughout their venture planning. We have seen several ventures popping up through this track and hence have been adopting it for the last six years now.",

The program starts from second year of engineering to the pre-final year. The final year is still available to the students to grow their business and validate themselves, if its worth pursuing it.  The course is specifically designed and vetted out by subject matter experts and taught by pioneers in each field. It focuses more on identifying and getting clarity of the problem first than talking about the solution. It covers areas like Creativity, Design thinking, Jobs to be Done, Entrepreneurial Mindset, Innovation tools and Methods, Lean Startup & Product Design, Fundamentals of Business, Venture Investment, Intellectual Property and all this finally leading to New Venture Formation. The basic expectation is to motivate students to start their won venture while still pursuing engineering and start looking at brighter side of business growth.",
